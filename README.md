# Credit-Card-Analysis

To develop a comprehensive weekly credit card dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, the project aims to analyze weekly credit card transaction data alongside customer information. The objectives are:

KPI Measurement: Measure and analyze various aspects of credit card data, including revenue generated, transaction volume, total interest earned, delinquency rate, customer acquisition cost, and customer satisfaction score. By monitoring these KPIs, businesses can assess performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to drive growth and profitability.

Revenue Analysis by Quarter, Week, and Month: Conduct revenue analysis segmented by quarters, weeks, and months. This analysis aims to uncover revenue trends, seasonality effects, and fluctuations in customer spending patterns over time.

Customer Spending Habits and Card Category Analysis: Explore customer spending behaviors and preferences across different card categories (e.g., gold, platinum) and expenditure types (e.g., bills, entertainment, travel). Analyzing this data provides insights into customer demographics, purchasing preferences, and spending patterns.

Customer Analysis Based on Different Metrics: Analyze revenue based on various customer information metrics such as educational level, job type, and income group.
